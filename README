GOTO
****

A faster way to  cd to commonly used directories inspired  by commacd. Tested on
Bash 5.1, but should work on most versions.

Installation
************

On most operatin systems with Bash run:

    $ curl -o ~/.goto.sh \
        -sSL https://gitea.gch.icu/ge/goto/raw/branch/master/goto.sh
    $ echo '[ -f ~/.goto.sh ] && . ~/.goto.sh' >> ~/.bashrc

Reread ~/.bashrc by command:

    $ source ~/.bashrc

Usage
*****

Available commands (actually is aliases to functions):

    s [<path>]      bookmark $PWD or <path> (save into ~/.gotosave).
    g [<pattern>]   goto directory. If you have only one bookmark dir will be
                    changed without prompt. Type dir number in prompt to cd.

Run `g` to show the entire list of bookmarks and select the one you need.

You don't even need  to press `Enter` to confirm your selection  -- just type in
the bookmark number. The exception is when you have a two-digit number (or more)
and you select a  bookmark whose number is less than 10. Then  you have to press
`Enter`.

You can pass the Perl regular expression  (processed by grep -Pi) as an for 'g'.
At the  same time, if  only one  bookmark is found,  then the directory  will be
changed directly to it. If there are  several bookmarks, you will be prompted to
choose the appropriate  one. Also you can use autocompletion  by pressing `Tab`.
It works in a similar way.

Examples
--------

Previously set up your commonly used dirs. Specify dir as argument:

    $ s ~/Documents
    $ s ~/Downloads

or cd into dir and simply run

    $ s

Goto directory by number:

    $ g
    0   ~/Documents/
    1   ~/Downloads/
    : <type number here, e.g. 1>
    => cd /home/user/Downloads

Goto '~/Downloads' directory by regex:

    $ g w
    => cd /home/user/Downloads

Another way :)

    $ g 'do[^c]'
    => cd /home/gd/Downloads

and etc.

Tips
****

Combining commacd, goto and Bash autocd option gives a great experience!

Add to you ~/.bashrc following:
    shopt -s autocd
Now you can type just directory name without 'cd' to change directory.
